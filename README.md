### Gameplay

1. **Starting**: Player 1 begins and can select any line on the grid (or any connected line in Connected mode)
2. **Line Selection**: Click on any highlighted (valid) line to select it

- **Game Mode**: Toggle between Player vs Player and Player vs Bot
- **Game Style**: Switch between Connected and Freeform modes
- **All settings**: Accessible through the "Options" button in the main game

### Developer Configuration

You can further customize the game by modifying constants in `main.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  gridSize: 10, // Default grid size (overridden by UI)
  dotSize: 16, // Size of dots in pixels
  lineWidth: 54, // Width of horizontal lines
  lineHeight: 8, // Height of lines
  players: ["Player 1", "Player 2"],
  playerColors: ["#ff4444", "#4444ff"], // Red and Blue
};

const CONSTANTS = {
  GRID_MIN_SIZE: 3, // Minimum grid size
  GRID_MAX_SIZE: 16, // Maximum grid size
  ANIMATION_DELAY: 150, // UI animation timing
  BOT_MOVE_DELAY: 100, // Bot thinking delay
  // ... additional timing and positioning constants
};
```

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

- **Mouse Click**: Select available lines
- **Options Button**: Access game configuration menu
- **Restart Button**: Reset current game
- **Visual Cues**:
  - Pulsing highlighted lines = available to select
  - Red lines = Player 1's selections
  - Blue lines = Player 2's selections
  - Highlighted player box = current turn
  - Colored squares = completed squares by each player

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend Only**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no frameworks or dependencies
- **Modular Design**: Separated into logical modules (main, bot, animations)
- **ES6 Modules**: Clean import/export structure
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Centralized State**: Single game state object managing all game data
- **Event-Driven**: Click-based interaction with comprehensive event handling

### Key Components

- **Grid Generation**: Dynamic creation of dots and lines with configurable sizes
- **Animation System**: Diagonal wave pattern for grid appearance with staggered timing
- **AI Opponent**: Random move bot with extensible architecture for future improvements
- **Dual Game Modes**: Connected vs Freeform gameplay styles
- **Line Validation**: Smart detection of valid moves based on current game style
- **Square Detection**: Algorithm to identify completed squares and award points
- **Turn Management**: Player switching, bonus turns, and game mode handling
- **UI Management**: Modal overlays, options menu, and winner display

### Game Logic

1. **Grid Initialization**: Creates NxN dot grid with connecting lines
2. **Move Validation**:
   - **Connected Mode**: Only lines connected to previous moves are valid
   - **Freeform Mode**: Any unselected line is valid
3. **Square Completion**: Detects when all 4 sides of a square are completed
4. **Score Management**: Tracks completed squares per player with real-time updates
5. **Win Detection**: Determines winner when majority of squares completed or game ends
6. **Bot AI**: Simple random selection from valid moves (extensible for smarter AI)

## üîß Customization

### Runtime Configuration

- **Grid Size**: Use the in-game slider (3x3 to 16x16)
- **Game Modes**: Toggle between Player vs Player and Player vs Bot
- **Game Styles**: Switch between Connected and Freeform modes

### Developer Customization

#### Changing Default Settings

```javascript
// In main.js CONSTANTS object
const CONSTANTS = {
  DEFAULT_GRID_SIZE: 8, // Change default grid size
  GRID_MIN_SIZE: 2, // Change minimum grid size
  GRID_MAX_SIZE: 20, // Change maximum grid size
  BOT_MOVE_DELAY: 500, // Make bot think longer
  ANIMATION_DELAY: 300, // Slower animations
};
```

#### Changing Colors

```javascript
// In main.js CONFIG object
playerColors: ["#00ff00", "#ff8800"], // Green and Orange
```

#### Animation Timing

```javascript
// In animations.js
export const ANIMATION_CONSTANTS = {
  DOT_ANIMATION_DELAY: 50, // Slower dot animations
  LINE_ANIMATION_DELAY: 30, // Slower line animations
};
```

### Advanced Styling

Modify `main.css` to customize:

- Visual themes and color schemes
- Animation effects and timing
- Layout and spacing
- Button styles and hover effects
- Grid appearance and sizing
